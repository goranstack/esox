= Esox Java Swing binding library
:toc: left
:icons: font
:sectnums:

Binds model values to Swing components using the observable pattern and Java reflection.

== What it does
Synchronize value changes between model and Swing components. A change of a model value updates the Swing component and a value entered in a Swing component updates corresponding value
in the model. The library also handle the case where a Swing UI should show the absence of a model. A case very common in a 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master%E2%80%93detail_interface[master-detail UI] when no master is selected.

The binding is defined by creating instances of objects called `AspectAdapter` that takes constructor arguments to define the binding. The binding is defined without any reference to a model instance and can therefore be located in the Swing component constructor. Once the Swing component is created it can handle different model instances with the same binding definition. 

== The purpose of the project
The library is developed by my friend Dennis and adapted to Maven conventions by me.

The purpose of this GitHub project is to provide documentation and stable releases as Maven dependencies to current users of the library.
There will be no extensive further development but some minor improvements will be implemented over time.
There are no plans to support JavaFx that has its own solution for binding.

But if you still fancy Java Swing and need a binding library give it a try. The library are successfully used in several in-house applications.

== Documentation
Although the library implements some kind of MVC pattern it has a slightly different vocabulary.
Read about it in the http://goranstack.github.io/esox[documentation].
